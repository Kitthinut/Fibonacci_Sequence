# Fibonacci Sequence Spiral 🌸

Welcome to Sakural!  
Check it out live here: [https://kitthinut.github.io/Fibonacci_Sequence/](https://kitthinut.github.io/Fibonacci_Sequence/)

---

### Why did I make this?  
Honestly, no particular reason — just felt like it!  
No grand purpose, just some fun with math and sakura blossoms 🌸✨

---

### What is it?  
- A cute, minimal web page visualizing Fibonacci numbers  
- Uses the golden ratio to plot a spiral with sakura emojis  
- You can choose how many Fibonacci terms to see  
- Pure frontend, no backend needed  (I'm Lazy)

---

### How to use  
- Open `index.html` in any modern browser  
- Enter the number of Fibonacci terms you want (up to 200 => Why would you want more than this?)  
- Watch the sakura spiral bloom!  

---

Feel free to fork, tweak, or just enjoy the math vibes 🍃  
No promises, just fun.
